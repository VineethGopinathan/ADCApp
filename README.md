Android Developer Challenge: helpful innovation, powered by On-Device Machine Learning + you!


My Idea is to develop an app for  users of all ages to take their selfies with the power of On- Device Machine Learning technology.
Selfies are really gave us special moments at occasions like Wedding, Birthdays and Parties. The proposed app idea is useful for taking selfies without interacting with device traditional camera. I.e. Users can take their selfies without tapping the capture button in their camera apps.
By Leveraging the power of ML Kit , Face detection and Object Detection are used for making great selfies by introducing and featuring different kinds of Selfies:
1.	User choose which type of Selfie to take as per the circumstance
2.	Hold the Mobile Front camera  to take their special kind of selfie.
3.	Share or post it within their social network circles.
My goal is to bring embellishing selfies with special and clear classification which will encourage to capture their good moments.
My Derived Selfie Classifications:
1.Single Selfie : A selfie with one person. 
2.Smile Selfie : Selfies with people are smiling.
3.Pair Selfie : Selfie with two persons.
4.Friends Selfie: Selfie with 3-5 persons.
5.Family Selfie : Selfie with 3/4 persons
6.Wink Selfie : Selfie with a wink
7.Groupie : Selfie with more than 5
And the list goes…
Advantages :
1.	I’ve seen lot people are trying hard to tap capture button while taking selfies. It can be easily solved.
2.	No need to carry Selfie stick. Just need to hold the device for selfie
