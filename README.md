This is an Android app for the #AndroidDevChallenge.

Android Developer Challenge: helpful innovation, powered by On-Device Machine Learning + you!

Tell us what your idea is. 

My Idea is to develop an app for  users of all ages to take their selfies with the power of On- Device Machine Learning technology.
Selfies are really gave us special moments at occasions like Wedding, Birthdays and Parties. The proposed app idea is useful for taking selfies without interacting with device traditional camera. I.e. Users can take their selfies without tapping the capture button in their camera apps.
By Leveraging the power of ML Kit , Face detection and Object Detection are used for making great selfies by introducing and featuring different kinds of Selfies:
1.	User choose which type of Selfie to take as per the circumstance
2.	Hold the Mobile Front camera  to take their special kind of selfie.
3.	Share or post it within their social network circles.
My goal is to bring embellishing selfies with special and clear classification which will encourage to capture their good moments.
My Derived Selfie Classifications:
1.Single Selfie : A selfie with one person. 
2.Smile Selfie : Selfies with people are smiling.
3.Pair Selfie : Selfie with two persons.
4.Friends Selfie: Selfie with 3-5 persons.
5.Family Selfie : Selfie with 3/4 persons
6.Wink Selfie : Selfie with a wink
7.Groupie : Selfie with more than 5
And the list goes…
Advantages :
1.	I’ve seen lot people are trying hard to tap capture button while taking selfies. It can be easily solved.
2.	No need to carry Selfie stick. Just need to hold the device for selfie


Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life. 



My plan is to work on this project by dividing the entire project into some stages of development
Phase 1:
1.	I will be working on Face detection for getting accurate output for enhancing the quality image from the Face Detector. It is essential for Creating different Selfie classification.
2.	Store or Share the output image in Gallery or Social networks respectively.
Phase 2: 
1.	By bringing on developing the news feed mechanism where the user can see their friend’s selfies and they can like, comment and Dedicate selfies with their friends.
2.	Develop user account Registration and Login with Firebase Auth service.
3.	Use Firebase Storage and Firebase Cloud support for storing and fetching the Selfies in the cloud into the News Feeds of users like in the Social network apps.


Phase 3(Future):

1.	By bringing more social network elements to engage with Selfies for the users.
2.	By using some more object models and real time Object detection while taking selfies
to create more kinds of Selfies.



If the app is possible, I could use Google Help in:
1.Developing the app with accurate results for detecting faces and objects from native device camera without using any third-party Camera libraries.
2. To get more on Google Material Design for UI/UX implementations in the app.
3. To get Effective Marketing and promotion strategies from Google play app marketing experts to bring the idea into billions of android users.
4. Also would like to know monetization of the app without compromising the user experience.

Timeline to bring the idea into real app:
Jan 1 - Jan 31 : Will work to develop phase 1 and make the app ready for beta release to Google play
Feb 1 - March -20 : Will plan to work  on Phase 2 and start more promotion  and branding
March 21 - April 30 : Will work on Phase 3 and global promotion



Tell us about you. 


My Name is Vineeth Gopinathan. I am from Thrissur district of Kerala, India. I am working as as a Software Engineer in a Kerala based Start-up, Webandcrafts Pvt.Ltd. I have 4.5 years of experience in both Android and iOS App development. 
As far as I am concerned, I am very much interested in developing apps like to bring more innovations into people lives.  I am also a mobile game developers and have published two games and one app in the Google play. 
Shells Magia and Rapid parity are the games that I published in Google play.( https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vinkisoft).

The idea I am proposing here is my dream project idea that was already in my mind from 2016. I would like to learn and implement more things in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence technology. I hope MLKit can do a lot of wonders in this mobile world.
